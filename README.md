# Group-Project-1:  Fun in The City

## Description
The page allows travellers to select their desired City from the map and add filters for the types of things they want to see in the City.  The filters and map data are passed to a second page which opens and presents the User with photos and information about the City itself, and a selection of top attractions matching the Users selection criteria.  Maps and details about those attractions are also provided.  Alternatively, the User can randomise from the first page and information about a randomly selected City and its attractions will be presented.

HTML, CSS (inc Pure.css) and JS were used to produce the web page.
Various API's are contacted to provide the required information, including Googlemaps, Wikipedia, Opentripmaps and Openweathermap.
